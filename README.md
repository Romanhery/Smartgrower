# ML From Scratch (By Roman)

This project is where I (Roman) learn how neural networks work by coding
every part from absolute scratch — no PyTorch, no TensorFlow.

## Goals
- Understand the math behind neural networks
- Build all matrix operations manually
- Create a working neural network that can learn
- Eventually expand to CNNs, RNNs, and more

## Structure
- math_utils.py → math functions (dot product, matrix multiply)
- neural_network.py → the neural network code
- main.py → training/testing code
